Merging branches -> switch to branch (master in most cases) in which branch is merging  
(1) git merge <branchName>

Fast forward v/s real merges:

Merge conflicts:
- When their are two changes in same line in two commits

Resolving merge conflicts:
(1) Abort merge
git merge --abort
(2) Resolve conflicts manually
(3) Use a merge tool

Strategies to reduce conflicts:
(1) Keep lines short
(2) Keep commits small and focused
(3) Merge often - multiple merging is possible
(4) Track changes to master - keep branch in sync with master
