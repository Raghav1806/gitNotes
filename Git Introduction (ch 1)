Keeps track of changes (especially text changes)

Version control system - Source code management system

Distributed version control - changes are stored as "patches".
Git tracks changes, not versions.

No need to communicate with a central server
- faster
- no network access required
- no single failure point

There is no master repository in Git, all repositories are considered equivalent.

Git is NOT usful for tracking non-text files.

Who should use git?
- anyone wanting to track edits.
- review hisory log of changes made.
- retrieve old versions.
- anyone needing to share changes with collaborators.
