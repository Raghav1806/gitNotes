git status -> 
(1) Returns where the head pointer points to 
(2) Which files are NOT being tracked 
(3) Which file have not been commited
(4) Which file has been changed

How to edit files:
(1) After files are added and saved in the desired repository, using git status command will show that few changes need to be saved. 
(2) We can save all the desired changes by using the git add <fileName> command, and then adding the commit using the git commit -m "Commit" command.

Viewing changes in file:
- : depicts initial status of file
+ : depicts the final modified file
(1) git diff: shows changes and it's index
(2) git diff <file name>: works for a specific file.
(3) git diff --staged: compares staging index with working directory.

Deleting files using git:
(1) Delete file normally
- git rm <file name>

(2) Use git rm <file name>: file is not even in trash

Moving and Renaming files:
(1) Manually rename the file
- Save and commit changes
(2) git mv <primaryFileName> <secondaryFileName>
- This can also be used to move one file into another.
