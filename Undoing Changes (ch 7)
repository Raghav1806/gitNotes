Undoing saved changes in a file -> changes which have not been added in git repo.
(1) git checkout -- <File Name>
-> -- indicates that we want to stay on the same branch.

Unstaging staged changes in a file -> changes which have been added in git repo -> changes are visible, but they are not saved in git repo.
(1) git reset HEAD <file name>

Amending Commits:
We can only edit the last commit, the one at which HEAD points to.
(1) git commit --amend -m "Message"

Retrieving old versions:
<Video 4 not clear>

Reverting a commit:
git revert <part of commit id>
revert-> all changes will be neglected for that commit.

Using reset to undo multiple commits -> manipulating the HEAD pointer -> rewinds back to a commit.
git reset 
(1) --soft  -> does not change staging index or working directory.
(2) --mixed(default) -> changes staging index, but does not change working directory.
(3) --hard -> changes staging index and working directory.

Removing untracked directories:
(1) git clean -n -> shows what would happen on execution 
(2) git clean -f
