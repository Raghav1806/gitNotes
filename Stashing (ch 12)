Note: stash@{0} is the reference of stash

Saving changes in the stash:
- Stash -> place where we can store changes temporarily without commiting
- Commit your changes or stash them before you can switch branches
(1) git stash save -m "Message"

Viewing stashed changes
(1) git stash list -> accessible even after switching branches
(2) git stash show stash@{0}
(3) git stash show -p stash@{0} -> similar to diff

Retrieving stashed changes
- Makes changes to the current branch
(1) git stash apply stash@{0} -> leaves a copy of stash
(2) git stash pop stash@{0} -> removes stash from memory 
(3) git stash save "message"

Deleting stashed changes (without applying them)
(1) git stash drop stash@{0}
(2) git stash clear
