Two tree architecture
Repository -> Working Directory (checkout)
Working Copy -> Repository (commit)

Git uses Three tree architecture

Repository -> Staging Index -> Working Directory
git commit file.txt <- git add file.txt <- 

Git Workflow
(1) file.txt is added to the working directory
(2) git add file.txt  or git add . -> this adds new file to the staging index
(3) git commit -> now this file exists in the repository
(4) git log -> shows sequence of changes made in the repository

Using Hash Values in git:
- git generates a checksum for each change set
- checksum algo converts data into simple number
- same data always equals same checksum
- changing data would change checksum


Head Pointer in git:
- pointer to "tip" of CURRENT branch in repository
- last state of repository, what was last checked out
- points to parent of next commit
