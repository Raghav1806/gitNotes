Using gitignore
project/.gitignore
(1) Very basic regular expressions
* ? [aeiou] [0-9]
(2) negate expressions with !
*.php
!index.php
(3) ignore all files in a directory with trailing slash
assets/videos/
(4) nano .gitignore -> add all the files you want to ignore in this folder.

Ideas on what to ignore:
(1) compiled source code
(2) packages and compressed files
(3) logs and databases
(4) operating system generated files
(5) user uploaded assets (images, PDFs, videos)

Globally ignoring files
(1) ignore files in all repositories
(2) settings not tracked in repository
(3) user-specific instead of repository-specific

Ignoring tracked files
(1) nano .gitignore
(2) add file being tracked to the folder
-> NOTHING happens
(3) git rm --cached <file name>
-> removes file from staging index
